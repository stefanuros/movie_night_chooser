Movie Night Chooser

A flutter app made to help groups choose a movie to watch if they cannot come to a decision on which movie to watch.

## Description

A flutter app made to help users decide which movie to watch. Multiple users can join a single "room" and suggest movies. Once all of the suggestions are in, the host, the person that created this specific room, activates the choosing functionality. The app then chooses a random movie that was suggested by the users. When users suggest movies, the app tries to fetch info about the movie like genre, watch time, and ratings. These are not taken into account when choosing but may help the users decide for themselves which movie to watch.
